MRS talks about wishes; MRT talks about costs;
how should she choose?
Microeconomics has a concept called the Marginal
Rate of Transformation (MRT). It's defined as: given
limited resources, how much of another must you give

yoU

more; you have to lose less. |suddenly thought of this

binding her to the male lead. The female lead is bound
to a
""Conquerthe Male Lead System 
She has a fixed
amount Of daily task points (like a resource budget)
that she can freely allocate The system provides
several task options, each with different costs and
rewards: She has tWo options:

Training: Read for 3 hours
Female lead gains +10
independent growth points
(Side Quest B]
Intimate Interaction: Late-night umbrella delivery
forehead-to-forehead contact for 30 seconds

lead's affection +20
Insufficient task points; only
one can be completed. She hesitated. The system
urged:
(Please select a task path]
She began to
calculate in her mind: ""If | choose B, my favorability will
increase quickly; but
won't be able to increase my
growth value today:
""If| choose A,i seems like I'm
taking a steady approach, but the male lead's progress
willfall behind。
At this moment; she wasn't making
an emotional choice; but rather a Marginal Rate of
Change (MRT) calculation:
'How much growth value
am
willing to sacrifice to gain
1 more unit af
favorability?"" ""Is this exchange ratio worthwhile?"" She
chose to give him the umbrella. After completing the

the morning rush hour; |'m speechless]
This morning; the Kwasa Damansara line experienced a
major disruption。
arrived at Kuchai station around
8.20 AM, only to encounter a train that was delayed by
15 minutes. Normally, trains run
5 minutes; but
today; with the delay; the platform Was instantly
packed. Three trains came in a row, but | couldn't get
onatall; there were just too many people; and every
time the doors opened, it Was a shove。 | could only
Watch helplessly as the trains left
fnally managed to
squeeze onto the train around 8:50 AM,and with the
journey; |arrived at the station around 9:05 AM. By the
time | got to work i Was already 9:15 AM. This journey
usually takes about 15 minutes, but
i dragged
on foralmost 40 minutes_
really hope the train
schedule during rush hour can be more consistent
Leaving early is useless 讦 there's a delay;

and hit me in the face. My glasses fell to the ground.
Peoplearound me screamed Then a man helped me
pick up my glasses。
chased after him; hesitating
whether to tell him or not. After getting on the

mustered up my courage and caught up
with him 'Uncle; you hit mein the

Who answered the phone said they couldn't send
anyone down and told me to call the police online The
online caller then told me to find MRT staff to assist
with the investigation
went there; and we described
the incident in the staff room, verified my identity; and
Waited for the police to arrive. About ten minutes later;
four young police officers arrived;, two of whom were
handling their first case (from their conversation):
explained the incident
(1 don't know how many
tmes | cried
during this time):
helped me confirm

time;
told me that a
higher-level officer would
come down shortly and give me a document to take to
the State Courts Complex The people there would
continue to follow up on my case. Throughout the
process; these four police officers kept apologizing to
me; saying
could only do so much and that

Went to celebrate Christmas Eve near KLCC. After the
celebration, around 8:30 pm; We took the LRT back to
school. We were on a train Without women-only
carriages; SO We randomly entered one It was crowded;
and there were no seats left; so we huddled togetherin
a small circle; holding onto the middle rail. At that
moment
SaW a
foreign worker (looked like he was
Bangladeshi?) standing diagonally opposite me: We
made eye contact about three times. At first。
thought
hmm, maybe it's normal to make eye contact When
we're diagonally opposite each other But then my
friend standing next to me suddenly said:
Don'tyou
think its scary to have someone wearing black clothes
in the carriage?"" She said she felt the foreign worker
Was
staring at her, and she kept making eye contact
with him
At that point
We realized
something Was
wrong. At the next stop, people started getting Off one
after another, and there were tWo empty seats: One of
my friends and | ran to those two seats (by this time;
my seat was in the same row as the foreign worker, no
longer diagonally opposite him); while my other two
friends continued to stand in the same place
(diagonally opposite the foreign worker). After | sat
down;
pretended to look in the direction of the
foreign worker, and
found that he really Was staring at
my friend。
After a While; he turned his head and
looked at us, and
made eye contact with

that point; We were about four or five stops away

told me not to misunderstand, that she had a few
hundred Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) on
enough for a

tonight; which would cost around RM1000 + per night
She emphasized that she wasn't short of money, just

Taking the MRT: No traffic jams, can use your

Why can

Also, renting near the MRT

Taking the bus is

thrilling experience on the Kuala Lumpur
LRT
The
happened on Christmas Eve; December 24,
2025 (I'm only just remembering to post this now so
more friends can
bealerted) |remember reading to the
end; the
last part Was really scary. That day, three friends and |
Went to celebrate Christmas Eve near KLCC
After the
celebration, around 8:30 pm; we took the LRT back to
school. We were on a train Without women-only
carriages; SO We randomly entered one. It was crowded
and there were no seats left; so we huddled togetherin
a small circle;
holding onto the middle rail. At that
moment | saw a
foreign worker (looked like he was
Bangladeshi?) standing diagonally opposite me: We
made eye contact about three times. At first; | thought;
hmm, maybe it's normal to make eye contact When
we're diagonally opposite each other: But then my
friend standing next to me suddenly said: ""Don'tyou
think its scary to have someone wearing black clothes
in the carriage?"" She said she felt the foreign worker
Was
staring at her, and she kept making eye contact
with him
At that point; We realized something Was
wrong. At the next stop, people started getting Off one
after another, and there were tWo empty seats: One of
my friends and | ran to those two seats (by this time
my seat was in the same row as the foreign worker, no
longer diagonally opposite him); while my other two
friends continued to stand in the same place
(diagonally opposite the foreign worker) After | sat
down;
pretended to look in the direction of the
foreign worker, and
found that he really Was staring at
my friend。
After a While; he turned his head and
looked at us, and
made eye contact with
again.At
that point; We were about four or five stops away

First; take the KJ line to the last stop on the MRT and
get off at Exit A (one way RM1.8). Then take the T451

Or PKP,get
Off at the stop where you see the
course (one way
RMI). You can also
back on
where you got
Off; but it will take you on a campus tour, Which takes
about 20 minutes. After the campus tour;
return

might be concerned about this factor, but those witha
different perspective might find the area relatively
You can judge based on your own
feelings。
Aster Residence
Station: MRT Taman
Connaught Station
Features: This place is close to a
high-voltage power tower; so radiation concerns may
arise; especially for those sensitive to

Features: Close to a

Kelana
LRT malfunction
The Kelana Jaya Line experienced another malfunction
during rush hour, leaving many commuters stranded at
stations and disrupted. This is not the first time the line
has malfunctioned at a critical time;
the relevant
authorities have been slow to resolve the issue; Which
is disappointing Each time the system malfunctions;
the Ministry Of Transport's response is identical: social
media notifications; public apologies, and suggestions
to passengers to use alternative modes of transport
However, this mechanical approach fails to truly
alleviate the inconvenience to the public Public
transport disruptions are notjust about time delays;
severely disrupt work; study, and daily life. As one
of the busiest light rail lines; the Kelana Jaya Line
carries millions of passengers daily, including
commuters; students; and the elderly: When the system
malfunctions; the impact is far-reaching: commuters
are late or forced to take time Off work; students miss
classes and exams; and the elderly are unable to access
medical care on time, affecting their treatment Using
alternative transport seems like a solution, but it's not
feasible for many passengers. Ride
services are
overwhelmed during peak hours; with prices soaring;
making them unaffordable for many; even 讦 people are
willing to pay; they may not be able to hail a ride。
Transport Minister Anthony Loke visited Singapore to
learn from its efficient MRT operation. Singapore's
success lies in its strict implementation of ""regular
maintenance and proactive upkeep:
Does Malaysia's
LRT system have a similar mechanism?
there
preventative maintenance and rapid response plans? Is
there a long-term plan to comprehensively improve
the quality of public transport? In contrast, Malaysia
rushes to repair after accidents, but lacks transparenqy
and accountability afterwards; with no accountability

Gombak out of service again?!
[LRT Pasar Seni
Gombak Outage Again?!]
According to sources; the outage may be due to
maintenance on the switch track or signaling system;
causing the train to fail to automatically switch tracks;
resulting in a safety judgment failure: The Kelana
line has been experiencing frequent outages recently;
posing a
significant safety hazard to commuters:
When encountering line outages and
the
following options are worth considering: 1. Take a
bus/shuttle service
Check Rapid KLor official
announcements for free shuttles or alternative buses
Take a Grabltaxi-Although the cost is higher, the time
is more controllable. 3. Transfer to other
MRTIsubway/bus routes-If your destination allows;
this provides flexibility. 4
attention to official
announcements and real-time statusFollow
MyRapid /Rapid KL on Twitter or official platforms
Because of the recent frequent outages and almost
daily mishaps in the rail transit system, We recommend
that you avoid using rail transit until it is operational

Please be aware of the LRT Damai malfunction
tomorrow!
Everyone's still on LRT Damai at this time. And this
time;
suddenly took Station 2 to Gombak; then
Went to Putra Heights
then went back to Station 1
to take the LRT back to Damai, and then waited. When
to Sri Rampai, they had to go to Wangsa
Maju,and after a few stops;
had to wait for
another LRT train at Sri Rampai to continue to Gombak
